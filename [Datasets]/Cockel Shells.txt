Silent springs of stillness rings, 
Of silver bells and cockle shells
Cursive printing on my fifty
Shades of grey and black and white.
Mar the sun, and curse my run,
footsteps trailing lies in sand
Wash away the light of day, 
And spin my back onto the land
What of penance, hand in hand
You hold a finger to my lips.
What of shadows kissing eyes,
Bite the feeding, fight to lick
Terror stalking on the farthings
Counting sheep and lions weep
Tear stained camo mark the shallow
Cast the blade and make her sleep
Close said eyes and waiting rumbles
Earthquakes shatter all but she
Waiting patience, on those nations
Break the spell for gaze to peek.
Puzzles broke in riddles wrath
And unsolved mysteries so dry,
Hire slaves to play the bidding,
Never stop to wonder why.
