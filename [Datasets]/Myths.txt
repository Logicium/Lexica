[MYTHS]

What fairytale is written
With an inkless pen,
What silent bells to toll at night, 
And waken dreams of shackled flight
Yet here I am still standing, 
My feet planted to earth
I wish to rise above the clouds, 
I wish to journey to the hearth.

But wishes are but empty, 
Meaning void of thought
Featureless bits of paper,
To flutter ‘skance at such a lot.

Your eyes were meant for reading,
And not to look at form, 
Take blade and stop the bleeding, 
And blind yourself from fate forlorn.
You are built only for books, 
To fill your mind with facts, 
Not with silly visions
Of ardor sewn in human acts. 
You’ll never find the seeker, 
It merely not exist, 
A story wait to happen, 
Is nothing but a myth.
Always true, 
but never real, 
You taunt yourself with dreams to feel,
Not even a single touch. 
You may not have--
Even this much.
