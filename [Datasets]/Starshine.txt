Words will not capture,
Nor tongue to curl enrapture,
What eye or thought to betray,
The mind to rot, the heart decay.
 
Where the land meets the sea, 
Locked incessant embrace,
Worn to a thousand piece
Such innocence & kind deface.

Broken were the halls of grief,
Enshroud in every color
Rivers flow and clenching teeth, 
Phantom, ghost, & deadened lover

Shattered were the thoughts of home,
Doth these feet in shade they roam,
House of glass, hear my voice, 
Logic lies, truth dies of choice.

Empty eyes & holes of black,
Cosmic rage my hand enact.
You don’t need your eyes to see,
You don’t need your blood to bleed.

Crowned in crows and bone,
Ornate necklace of pallor’d tone
Ring of crystal tears
Footsteps writ in all his fears.

In my chest, a beat, I lack,
But time to fall, t’wilt not come back.
Only lost it slips away,
Descend into the end of day.

Death tells me things,
Alas to me what he brings.
In your heart, the end of time.
Counting stars cease to shine.
