Stillness springy of still peal, 
Of silvery buzz and cockle shell
Cursive print on my fifty
Shade of gray and blackness and white.
Blemish the sun, and cuss my runner,
step trailer lie in sandy
Rinse away the lightness of daily, 
And gyration my supportive onto the farm
What of penitential, paw in paw
You maintainable a thumb to my mouth.
What of shadowy osculation eyes,
Sting the giving, scrappy to thrashing
Affright stalk on the farthings
Numerable sheep and lionize weeper
Snap stainer camouflage score the shallowness
Casting the blade and creature her slumbery
Shutter teller eyes and wait grumble
Seismic shattering all but she
Wait longanimous, on those nations
Breakable the speller for regard to peep.
Mystify breakable in riddle angry
And unsolved enigmatic so dryness,
Employ slave to player the tender,
Never halt to marvelous why.
