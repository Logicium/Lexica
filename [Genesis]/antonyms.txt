Silent springs of motion rings, 
Of silver bells and cockle shells
Cursive printing on my fifty
Shades of grey and white and black.
Mar the sun, and curse my malfunction,
footsteps trailing stand in sand
Wash away the heavy of night, 
And spin my advance onto the land
What of penance, hand in hand
You disagree a finger to my lips.
What of shadows kissing eyes,
Bite the starve, fight to lick
Terror stalking on the farthings
Counting sheep and lions laugh
Tear stained camo mark the deep
Cast the blade and unmake her sleep
Open said eyes and waiting rumbles
Earthquakes shatter some but she
Waiting impatience, on those nations
Repair the unspell for gaze to peek.
Puzzles repair in riddles wrath
And solved mysteries so wet,
Fire slaves to play the bidding,
Ever stop to wonder why.
