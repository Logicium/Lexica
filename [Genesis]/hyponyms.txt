Silent bedspring of stationariness ding, 
Of silver knell and cockle shrapnel
Minuscule gravure on my fifty
Crosshatch of silver and black and paleface.
Birthmark the sunburst, and anathema my trot,
tramp tree nestle in sand
Elute away the light of tomorrow, 
And whirligig my guarantee onto the farmstead
What of confession, fist in fist
You pressurize a finger to my overlip.
What of umbra smack eyes,
Snakebite the dine, gunfight to tongue
Swivet stalking on the farthings
Recount ewe and lioness wail
Lacerate ebonize camo percentile the shallow
Shoot the vane and overdo her sleeping
Snap present eyes and ambush rumbles
Shock shatter all but she
Ambush canfield, on those tribe
Stop the misspell for gaze to peek.
Sudoku stop in spiritize wrath
And unsolved mysteries so dry,
Featherbed slaves to curl the subscribe,
Never cessation to awe why.
